            # Why Cybersecurity Matters

            - Cyber attacks target **people as much as systems**  
            - A single click can cause:  
              - Data breaches  
              - Downtime & lost productivity  
              - Financial & reputation damage  
            - **Security is everyone‚Äôs responsibility**

            ---

            # Common Threats

            - **Phishing** ‚Äì fake emails/links pretending to be real  
            - **Malware/Ransomware** ‚Äì harmful software that locks or steals data  
            - **Weak Passwords** ‚Äì easy for attackers to guess  
            - **Unpatched Systems** ‚Äì out-of-date software = easy target  

            ![](images/hacker-typing.gif)

            ---

            # Best Practices (Do‚Äôs)

            ‚úÖ Use **strong, unique passwords & Change frequently**  
            ‚úÖ Enable **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
            ‚úÖ Lock your computer when stepping away  
            ‚úÖ Keep software/apps updated  
            ‚úÖ Report suspicious activity immediately  

            ![](images/checkmark.gif)

            ---

            # What Not To Do (Don‚Äôts)

            ‚ùå Don‚Äôt click on suspicious links or attachments  
            ‚ùå Don‚Äôt reuse passwords across accounts

            ---

            # Safe Email & Password Use

            - Double-check sender addresses

            ![](images/email-security.gif)

            ---

            # Be Aware of Social Engineering

            - Attackers may impersonate **bosses, IT, or vendors**  
            - They rely on urgency or fear:  
              > ‚ÄúSend this now‚Äù  
              > ‚ÄúClick this to avoid account suspension‚Äù  
            - Always verify before acting
